## **README**

Please read this first before you continue using the app or if you experience problems running the app.

This application was created for my first project to create an application with CRUD functionality. 

Because this application is a simple application, it may have many shortcomings in terms of functions and features.

This application was created using Visual Studio Code with Python Extension (.py)

This application is not connected to any database. The data included in the application is dummy data.

Note : This application is using Bahasa as the interface language.^
